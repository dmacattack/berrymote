### IDE Setup
Download Qt Creator and install the SDK for Qt v5.9.7 


### Config file
Everything is allocated on the screen from the config file 'berrymote.json' because I don't want to implement an on screen keyboard. Plus its a raspberry pi, chances are you're already configuring things. Also it trims down the code & UI needed for configuring.
